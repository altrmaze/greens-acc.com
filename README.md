# GreenACC

GreenACC is a static website with Supabase backend support for secure trade escrow, AI-monitored handshake workflows, and payment lifecycle tracking.

## Project structure

- `index.html` — main static site
- `package.json` — build, start, and test scripts
- `supabase/schema.sql` — database schema for deals and payments
- `supabase/functions/processEntryFee.js` — edge function to process the flat $20 entry fee
- `supabase/functions/processWithdrawal.js` — edge function to release escrow only after all 3 AI agents verify compliance

## Supabase integration

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Add the `green_acc_deals` table using `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. Deploy edge functions from `supabase/functions/`.
4. Set environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Usage

- `npm run build` — build static site to `dist/`
- `npm start` — serve the site locally on port `5000`
- `npm test` — validate schema and edge function syntax

## Payment workflow

- Tracks mandatory $20 USD entry fee in `entry_fee_status`.
- Calculates 2% handshake commission using `handshake_commission_amount`.
- Locks funds in escrow until `ai_agent_status` is fully verified and `compliance_status` is verified.
- Uses `withdrawal_triggered` and `safe_withdrawal_ready` to prevent unauthorized fund release.

## Notes

- `processEntryFee.js` requires exactly $20.00 USD for fee processing.
- `processWithdrawal.js` gates withdrawal on handshake confirmation, compliance verification, and three AI agent verifications.

## Stripe & Webhook

- Deploy the Stripe webhook edge function at `supabase/functions/stripeWebhook.js` and set the following environment variables in your Supabase functions config or platform:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — your Stripe secret key
   - (Optional) `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — if you add signature verification later
- The webhook listens for `checkout.session.completed` and verifies the session with Stripe, then marks the `entry_fee_status` as `paid` in the `green_acc_deals` table.

## Deployment notes

- After deploying functions, set these environment variables in the edge functions runtime:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

## Files added in this update

- `supabase/functions/stripeWebhook.js` — Stripe webhook handler that validates session and patches Supabase
- `supabase/functions/createStripeCheckout.js` — creates Stripe Checkout sessions for the $20 entry fee
- `supabase/functions/createHandshakeSession.js` — handshake & L/C locking logic
- `success.html`, `cancel.html` — Stripe redirect pages
- `meeting.html` — Executive Meeting Suite UI (10 isolated rooms)
- `meeting.js` — client logic for rooms, AV preview, chat and AI integration
- `meeting.css` — styling for the meeting suite
- `supabase/functions/aiAgentAnalyze.js` — lightweight AI analysis stub (edge function)

## Meeting Suite realtime signaling

The Meeting Suite can use Supabase Realtime for WebRTC signaling. To enable it:

1. Set `window.SUPABASE_CONFIG` in `meeting.html` (or inject dynamically) with your Supabase project URL and anon key:

```html
<script>
   window.SUPABASE_CONFIG = { url: 'https://your-project.supabase.co', anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY' };
</script>
```

2. Apply the database schema in `supabase/schema.sql` which includes the `meeting_signals` table used for offer/answer/candidate exchange.

3. Deploy the Supabase Realtime and ensure anon key allows realtime subscriptions for authenticated or public users as appropriate.

Security note: For production, use Supabase Auth to sign in users and avoid exposing elevated keys on the client. Consider creating ephemeral tokens or server-side signaling proxies.
